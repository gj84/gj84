### Hi!

I am Germán, a software developer located in Argentina, but I like to work with people all over the world.

🛰️ I use Python and Javascript (put here lot of libs, frameworks and tools), relational databases and Linux, I have used Perl and C# too.
   I like working on automation problems, building things ranging from web crawlers to browser extensions. 

🌱 What can you expect from me?
  * Easy communication both in English and Spanish. I can also speak Italian.
  * Give and receive as many feedback as possible.
  * Deep dive into your details and specifications, to join the dots and understand the business logic.
  * Learn new technologies if necessary and devour docs.
  * I will be glad to get an agreement and collaborate with you to get the most out of our relationship.

📫  **How to reach me**: The simplest way is to ping me at [info.gjimenez@gmail.com](mailto:info.gjimenez@gmail.com) with any idea or project you want to discuss.
