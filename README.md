### Hi there 👋

I am Germán, a software developer located in Argentina, but I like to work with people all over the world.

🔭  I’m currently working at [Wiser Solutions](https://www.wiser.com/) developing web crawlers, with regular expresions and Perl mainly.

🐜  I have used Python (put here lot of libs, frameworks and tools), Javascript (same), relational databases and Linux with that powerful tool handled only by text 😜.
 
💡  I really like working on user automation problems, and I have build things ranging from web crawlers to browser extensions.

🐬  I’m currently learning Java and Clojure, a mostly OOP and a mostly functional language. Learning tech, hobbies and sports are *"my hobbies"*.

🌱  What can you expect from me?
  * Respect, tolerance and easy communication both in English and Spanish. I can also speak Italian.
  * Answer the first contact as soon as *I will be available*.
  * After the inital contacts, I'll answer the messages ASAP (email, Slack, Telegram, others) and attend the appointments on time. 
  * Give and receive as many feedback as possible.
  * Deep dive into your details and specifications, to join the dots and understand the business logic.
  * Learn new technologies as necessary.
  * I will be glad to get an agreement and collaborate with you to get the most out of our relationship.

📫  **How to reach me**: I am not the biggest fan of how social networks have evolved, so the simplest way is to ping me at [info.gjimenez@gmail.com](info.gjimenez@gmail.com) with any idea or project you want to discuss.
