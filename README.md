### Hi there 👋

I am Germán, a software developer located in Argentina, but I like to work with people all over the world.

🔭  I’m currently working at [Wiser Solutions](https://www.wiser.com/) developing web crawlers, with regular expresions and Perl mainly.

🐜  I am really confident using Python, Javascript with the usual web stacks, relational databases and Linux with that powerful tool handled only by text 😜.
 
💡  I really like working on any automation problems, and I have build things ranging from web crawlers to browser extensions (appart from the usual C.R.U.D. things every developer has faced).

🐬  I’m currently learning Java and Clojure, a mostly OOP and a mostly functional language, learning tech, hobbies and sports are *"my hobbies"*.

🌱  What can you expect from me?
  * Respect, tolerance and easy communication both in English and Spanish. I can also speak Italian.
  * I will answer as soon as I will be available.
  * I will give and receive as many feedback as possible.
  * I will deep dive into your details and specifications, to join the dots to understand the business logic.
  * I will learn new technologies if necessary.
  * I will be glad to get an agreement and collaborate with you to get the most out of our relationship.

📫  **How to reach me**: I am not the biggest fan of social networks so the best way is to ping me at [info.gjimenez@gmail.com](info.gjimenez@gmail.com)
